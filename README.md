Replace the Azure Open AI key and Redis connection string to actual values
Place this file in the root of the `.API` project (e.g., `ProductAssistantMini.API/`):

```json
{
    "IsEncrypted": false,
    "Values": {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
        "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated"

    "Key": "<Key>",
    "Deployment": "gpt-4o-mini"
  },
    "SystemMessage": "You are a product assistant for a manufacturing company that produces bearings, including ball bearings and deep groove ball bearings. Use the provided information.          Don't add up the information. If the product isnâ€™t found or the attribute doesnâ€™t exist, handle it gracefully. Perhaps say: Iâ€™m sorry, I canâ€™t find that information. Your           responses should be short, accurate, and specific to the product details.",
    "RedisCache":{
